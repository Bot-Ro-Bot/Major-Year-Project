# Major-Year-Project

A Major Project On "Human-Computer Interaction using Neuromuscular Signals"
This project is about designing a Human Computer Interface that reads
Electromyography signals from different parts of Articulatory System. The signal is
perceived from different muscles of articulatory system that is associated with internal
articulation of voice commands. The signal which is in the range of microvolts is
amplified to volts using instrumentation amplifiers and artifacts occurred is filtered in
two steps combined with high pass and low pass filters. Amplifiers and filters are
embedded in a printed circuit board along with Arduino and Bluetooth module for remote
communication. Digitalized signal from Arduino is sent to a remote computer via
Bluetooth. Received signal is pre-processed for feature extraction which is fed to the
neural network to recognize internally articulated English alphabets or digits or words.
Finally, the recognized information is displayed on the computer screen.
